Machine Learning project: Predicting student marks from study hours with live web UI.

Student Marks Prediction using Linear Regression

📌 Project Overview
This project predicts student exam marks based on study hours using a Linear Regression model.

The project includes:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Train-test split
- Model evaluation using R² score
- Web application for user interaction

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit / Web Framework

 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Created dataset
2. Visualized relationship between study hours and marks
3. Split data into training and testing
4. Trained Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated model using R² score
6. Built web application for prediction

 Model Performance
- R² Score on Test Data: 0.38
- Shows positive relationship between study hours and marks

 How to Run Locally
1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run application:
